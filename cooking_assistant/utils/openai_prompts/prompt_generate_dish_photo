A cozy, with minimum details "photo" representing a cooked dish. What the dish is: {summary}.
The image should reflect the dish’s key characteristics and evoke a warm, inviting feeling.
Use soft, muted tones that match the app’s color palette: a warm cream background (#fff8df), soft yellow highlights (#f2d776), and subtle accents of light beige and pastel tones.
Ensure the image is clean and simple, avoiding clutter.
